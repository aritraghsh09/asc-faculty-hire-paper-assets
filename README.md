## Yale Astronomy Student Council Faculty Hire Survey

In 2022, the Department of Astronomy at Yale University initiated a search for a new faculty member. Current graduate students were given the opportunity to interact with all the shortlisted candidates via an hour-long meeting, as well as the candidate's colloquium and other informal departmental interactions. To reduce subjectivity, the Yale Astronomy Student Council (ASC) designed and implemented a procedure to gather and present data collected from all graduate students during these interactions. These data and an associated write-up were presented at a department faculty meeting at the end of the candidate interview process. 
 
In the Fall of 2022, we wrote up a [publicly available document](https://baas.aas.org/pub/fpf0fcu1) on this survey inspired by the overwhelming positive response to the faculty hiring survey from both students and faculty. This repository  contains all the data products that are mentioned in the paper.
